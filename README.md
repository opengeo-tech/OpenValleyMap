The open geospatial database of boundaries and the toponymy of all the valleys in the Alps.

## Algorithms

the construction of the boundaries is generated starting from the datasource using some [projects in qgis](jupyter/qgis) and a [jupyter notebook](jupyter) with geospatial libraries in python for optimization
